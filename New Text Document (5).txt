binte dil misriya mein

the girl of heart is in Egypt.

pesh hai kul shabaab

khidmat-e-aali janaab

aatish-kada adaaon se

aatish-kada adaaon se

jal uThega aapke

deeda-e-tar ka hijaab

(hence), presented is all this beauty

in the service of your greatness.

(in short, all this beauty is there in your service.)

with these ever-burning (flirtatious) gestures,

the veil of your tearful eyes

will be burned.

(that is, you'll forget all your sorrow under the effect of my beauty.)

bint-e dil misriya mein

bint-e dil misriya mein…

maikash labon pe aane lagi hai

pyaasi kurbatein

hairatzada Thikaane lagi hain

saari furqatein

thirsty troubles have started coming to

the liquored lips,

and all the astonished separations

have gone away.

(that is, the feeling of separation from the beloved is gone and he's enjoying himself now.)

aarizon pe mere likh zara

rif'atein chaahaton ka sila...

write on my cheeks,

progresses, and the results of love.

[Aariz means a cheek, but it also means something/someone who tries to stop you. So I believe it can also be read as 'write the story of my progresses on those that try to stop me'.]

binte dil misriya mein

binte dil misriya mein

pesh hai kul shabaab

khidmat-e-aali janaab

aatish-kada adaaon se

aatish-kada adaaon se

jal uThegaa aapke

deeda-e-tar ka hijaab

binte dil misriya mein

binte dil misriya mein...
